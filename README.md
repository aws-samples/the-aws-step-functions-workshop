## What's Included

This project contains the following folders:
* `static`: This folder contains static assets to be hosted alongside the workshop (ie. images, scripts, documents, etc) 
* `content`: This is the core workshop folder. This is generated as HTML and hosted for presentation for customers.

## How to create content

Under the `content` folder, Each folder requires at least one `index.<lang>.md` file. The file will have a header

```aidl
+++
title = "AWS Workshop Template"
weight = 0

```

The title will be the title on navigation panel on the left. The weight determines the order the page appears in the navigation panel.
