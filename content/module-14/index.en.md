Data processing involves discrete steps for ingesting, processing, storing the transformed data, and post-processing, such as visualizing or analyzing the transformed data. You can use Step Functions to orchestrate these steps and create scalable data processing pipelines as part of a larger business application.

### Examples of Step Functions in Data Processing include:

- Orchestrate AWS Glue crawlers on an Amazon S3 bucket and execute Amazon Athena queries on the dataset.
- Quickly analyze gigabytes of data in Amazon S3 using thousands of concurrent workflows with Step Functions Distributed Map state
- Process streaming data off of Amazon Kinesis in real-time using Step Functions Express Workflows.
