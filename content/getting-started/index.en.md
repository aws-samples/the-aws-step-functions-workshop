### Hosted option

If you are at an AWS hosted event (eg. AWS re\:Invent, AWS Summit, Immersion Day, etc.) you may be provided a temporary AWS account with the workshop resources already provisioned. You may request a hosted workshop from your AWS account team. To navigate to your account [follow these instructions](./hosted-event).

### Self-service option

If you want to run this workshop in your own AWS account, follow the set up and clean up instructions provided inside each module. To start with the first module [click here](../module-1).
