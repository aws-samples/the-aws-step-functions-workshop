In your account, you have a state machine with a name beginning with _ParentStateMachine_. The state machine currently is currently a Standard workflow. As mentioned in the beginning of the module, this might be necessary if your workflow utilizes a feature only available to Standard workflows, like the .waitForTaskToken feature, or because the workflow duration could exceed 5 minutes, or because you need an "exactly once" execution model.  

However, note the circled steps below. Letâ€™s assume that these steps are idempotent and would be fine in an "at least once" execution model, like the one Express workflows provide. We could move those steps to a nested Express workflow.
